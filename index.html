  <h1> Becky: The Chubby Puppy</h1>
    <p>This is a story about a puppy called Becky! Becky is not your ordinary hound. Nope. This website is dedicated towards describing chubby
    Becky bringing to light her favorite food, toys, games and a gallery of some of the moments I have captured. Judging from the gallery, it
    is easy for anyone to fall in love with this dog. Becky is not your every day dog. Enjoy!

    <h2>Becky's Bio::::::::</h2>
  <p> Becky was born in late 2014 to her two lovely parents Annabel and Ceasar. Becky borrows most of her physical features from
    her mother who has an extra thick fur coat, a shiny back and a long fluffy tail. Becky weighs approximately thirty kilograms and is a
    trained dog who can detect <b>drugs, firearms, illegal goods such as ivory</b> and many more things.</p>
